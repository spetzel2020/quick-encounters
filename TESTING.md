## OLDER TESTING (only on major release)
### BUG FIXES
1. Create 10 saved tokens - check that QE positions saved tokens correctly                                  OK in 0.0.0
2. Reduce 10 to 5 - check that QE positions saved tokens correctly                                          OK in 0.9.0
3. Increase 5 back to 10 - extra 5 tokens should be generated next to Map Note                              OK in 0.9.0
### TUTORIAL
1. Press Quick Encounter button with nothing selected -> should pop up Tutorial					 			OK in 0.9.0

### TEST WITH Foundry 0.7.9
May need to test for version:
- Test CONST.TOKEN_DISPOSITIONS

### USE OLD EMBEDDED METHOD - DEPRECATED
Verify above tests with Use Companion Dialog = TRUE and Use Companion Dialog = FALSE
1. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = TRUE
2. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = FALSE
3. Create a new Encounter with the "Use new Companion Dialog" = FALSE
